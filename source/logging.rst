.. _logging:


Logging into your Raspberry Pi
==============================


 Once your Raspberry Pi has complete the boot process, a login prompt will 
 appear. The default login for Raspbian is username **pi** with the password 
 **raspberry**. Note you will not see any writing appear when you type the 
 password. This is a security feature in Linux.

 After you have successfully logged in, you will see the command line prompt 
 *pi@raspberrypi~$*
