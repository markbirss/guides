.. _logging:

Initial setup
=============

Logging into your Raspberry Pi
------------------------------


 Once your Raspberry Pi has completed the boot process, a login prompt will 
 appear. The default login for Raspbian is username **pi** with the password 
 **raspberry**. Note you will not see any writing appear when you type the 
 password. This is a security feature in Linux.

 After you have successfully logged in, you will see the command line prompt 
 *pi@raspberrypi~$*
