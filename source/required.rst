Required
========

1 SD Card
----------
We recommend an 16GB SD card.


2 Display and connectivity cables
----------------------------------
Any HDMI/DVI monitor or TV should work as a display for the Pi.
For best results, use one with HDMI input, but other connections 
are available for older devices.Use a standard Ethernet cable for 
internet access.

3 Keyboard 
----------
Any standard USB keyboard will work with your Raspberry Pi.

4 Power supply
---------------
Use a 5V micro USB power supply to power your Raspberry Pi. Be 
careful that whatever power supply you use outputs at least 5V; 
insufficient power will cause your Pi to behave in strange ways.

5 Internet connection
----------------------
To update or download software, we recommend that you connect your 
Raspberry Pi to the Internet via an Ethernet cable.

6 USB Wi-Fi dongle 
------------------
This tutorial is using a TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps **or** a TP-Link TL-WN725N.
