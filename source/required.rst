SD Card
-------

We recommend a 8GB or 16GB SD card.


Display and connectivity cables
-------------------------------

Any HDMI/DVI monitor or TV should work as a display for the Pi.
For best results, use one with HDMI input, but other connections 
are available for older devices.Use a standard Ethernet cable for 
internet access.

Keyboard
--------

Any standard USB keyboard will work with your Raspberry Pi.

Power supply
------------

Use a 5V micro USB power supply to power your Raspberry Pi. Be 
careful that whatever power supply you use outputs at least 5V. 
Insufficient power will cause your Pi to behave in strange ways.

Internet connection
-------------------

To update or download software, we recommend that you connect your 
Raspberry Pi to the Internet via an Ethernet cable.

USB Wi-Fi dongle 
----------------

This tutorial is using a TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps **or** a TP-Link TL-WN725N.
