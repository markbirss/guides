computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse

SD Card
-------

We recommend a 8GB or 16GB SD card.

.. note::
   
   The card class determines the sustained write speed for the card, a class 4 card 
   will be able to write at 4MB/s, whereas a class 10 should be able to attain 10 MB/s.
   It would be preferable to buy a class 10 for better response of Raspberry pi


Display and connectivity cables
-------------------------------

Any HDMI/DVI monitor or TV should work as a display for the Pi.
For best results, use one with HDMI input, but other connections 
are available for older devices.Use a standard Ethernet cable for 
internet access.

Keyboard
--------

Any standard USB keyboard will work with your Raspberry Pi.

Power supply
------------

Use a 5V micro USB power supply to power your Raspberry Pi. Be 
careful that whatever power supply you use outputs at least 5V. 
Insufficient power will cause your Pi to behave in strange ways.

Internet connection
-------------------

To update or download software, we recommend that you connect your 
Raspberry Pi to the Internet via an Ethernet cable.

USB Wi-Fi dongle 
----------------

This tutorial is using a TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps, TP-Link TL-WN8200ND 300Mbps **or** a nano usb adapter TP-Link TL-WN725N.
