Plugging in your Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------

Before you plug anything into your Raspberry Pi, make sure that you have all the 
equipment listed above to hand. Then follow these instructions:

1) Begin by slotting your SD card into the SD card slot on the Raspberry Pi, which will only fit one way.


2) Next, plug in your USB keyboard into the USB slots on the Raspberry Pi.


3) Make sure that your monitor or TV is turned on and that you have selected the right input (e.g. HDMI 1, DVI, etc).


4) Then connect your HDMI cable from your Raspberry Pi to your monitor or TV.


5) If you intend to connect your Raspberry Pi to the Internet, plug in an ethernet cable into the ethernet port next to the USB ports, otherwise skip this step.


6) When you are happy that you have plugged in all the cables and SD card required, finally plug in the micro USB power supply. This action will turn on and boot your Raspberry Pi.
